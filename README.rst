QConnectBase Library
====================

QConnectBaseLibrary is a connection testing library for `Robot
Framework <https://robotframework.org>`__. Library will be supported to
downloaded from PyPI soon. It provides a mechanism to handle trace log
continously receiving from a connection (such as Raw TCP, SSH, Serial,
etc.) besides sending data back to the other side. It’s especially
efficient for monitoring the overflood response trace log from an
asynchronous trace systems. It is supporting Python 3.7+ and
RobotFramework 3.2+.

   **E.g.**

   ::

       ${result} = verify  conn_name=SSH_Connection
                            search_pattern=(?<=\s).*([0-9]..).*(command).$
                            send_cmd=*echo This is the 1st test command.*


   - ${result}[0] will be **"This is the 1st test command."** which is the matched string.
   - ${result}[1] will be **"1st"** which is the first captured string.
   - ${result}[2] will be **"command"** which is the second captured string.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

QConnectBaseLibrary is designed for ease of making an extension library. By that way you can take advantage of the QConnectBaseLibrary’s
infrastructure for handling your own connection protocal. For creating an extension library for QConnectBaseLibrary, please following below
steps.

1.  Create a library package which have the prefix name is **robotframework-qconnect-**\ *[your specific name]*.

2.  Your hadling connection class should be derived from **QConnectionLibrary.connection_base.ConnectionBase**  class.

3.  In your *Connection Class*, override below attributes and methods:

  -  **_CONNECTION_TYPE**: name of your connection type. It will be the input of the conn_type argument when using **connect** keyword. Depend on the type name, the library will detemine the correct connection handling class.

  -  **__init__(self, \_mode, config)**: in this constructor method, you should:

    - Prepare resource for your connection.
    - Initialize receiver thread by calling **self._init_thread_receiver(cls._socket_instance, mode="")** method.
    - Configure and initialize the lowlevel receiver thread (if it’s necessary) as below

      ::

        self._llrecv_thrd_obj = None
         self._llrecv_thrd_term = threading.Event()
         self._init_thrd_llrecv(cls._socket_instance)


    - Incase you use the lowlevel receiver thread. You should implement the **thrd_llrecv_from_connection_interface()** method. This method is a mediate layer which will receive the data from connection at the very beginning, do some process then put them in a queue for the **receiver thread** above getting later.
    - Create the queue for this connection (use Queue.Queue).

  - **connect()**: implement the way you use to make your own connection protocol.
  - **_read()**: implement the way to receive data from connection.
  - **_write()**: implement the way to send data via connection.
  - **disconnect()**: implement the way you use to disconnect your own connection protocol.
  - **quit()**: implement the way you use to quit connection and clean resource.

Configure Git and correct EOL handling
--------------------------------------

Here you can find the references for `Dealing with line
endings <https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/>`__.

Every time you press return on your keyboard you’re actually inserting
an invisible character called a line ending. Historically, different
operating systems have handled line endings differently. When you view
changes in a file, Git handles line endings in its own way. Since you’re
collaborating on projects with Git and GitHub, Git might produce
unexpected results if, for example, you’re working on a Windows machine,
and your collaborator has made a change in OS X.

To avoid problems in your diffs, you can configure Git to properly
handle line endings. If you are storing the .gitattributes file directly
inside of your repository, than you can asure that all EOL are manged by
git correctly as defined.

Sourcecode Documentation
------------------------

For investigating sourcecode, please refer to `QConnectBase library documentation <docs/html/index.html>`__

A detailed documentation of the QConnectBase package can also be found here: `QConnectBase.pdf <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-qconnect-base/blob/develop/QConnectBase/QConnectBase.pdf>`_

Feedback
--------

If you have any problem when using the library or think there is a
better solution for any part of the library, I’d love to know it, as
this will all help me to improve the library. Please don't hesitate
to contact me.

Do share your valuable opinion, I appreciate your honest feedback!
