QConnectBaseLibrary is a connection testing library for `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org>`__. Library will be supported to downloaded from PyPI soon. It provides a mechanism to handle trace log continously receiving from a connection (such as Raw TCP, SSH, Serial, etc.) besides sending data back to the other side. Itâ€™s especially efficient for monitoring the overflood response trace log from an asynchronous trace systems. It is supporting Python 3.7+ and RobotFramework 3.2+.
