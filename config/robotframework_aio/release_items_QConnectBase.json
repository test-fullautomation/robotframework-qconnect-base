**RMQSignal**
 
* RMQSignal provides a synchronization mechanism designed to facilitate inter-process communication (IPC) between Robot Framework test processes using RabbitMQ as the underlying message broker. 
  This module leverages RabbitMQ's message queues to enable communication and coordination between different test processes, allowing them to exchange signals, notifications, or other relevant information.
 
**Environment/Installation**
 
* For using RMQSignal, required to run the
  file QConnectBase/tools/setup rabbitmq.bat to install the entire infrastructure required for these Auxiliary Utilities.
